  <h1>Mohamed Salah - Liverpool Legend</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>Today, Mohamed Salah is regarded as one of the greatest 
   Liverpool players to ever grace Anfield. Since joing the club
  in 2017, he has been vital for the resurgent Liverpool under 
   manager Jurgen Klopp. But before this, Mohamed Salah was just
  a simple boy living in Nagrig, in the north of Egypt.</div>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <div><p><strong>Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly</strong> was born on the <em>15th
  of June, 1992</em> in Nagrig, Egypt.  Little information is known about 
  Salah's parents, but they are both of middle class social
  status. They are avid supporters of their son and Liverpool.
  Salah began to play football at the age of seven, and 
  discovered his passion for the game. Salah played for the
  youth setups of Ittihad Basyoun and Othmason Tanta. His
  idols, <em>Ronaldo Nazario, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti</em>, players
  who he often tried to emulate.</p>
  At the age of 14, Mohamed Salah joined the youth team of Al
  Mokawloon after being noticed by a scout who had orginally 
  come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.
  Due to the long distance to the club's headquarters, Salah
  frequently had to miss school as the 3 hour long journey
  to training. At the age of 15, first team manager Mohamed 
  Radwan noticed the young player and moved him up to the 
  senior squad immediately. Due to Mohamed Salah's young age, he
  was to be given a special diet as his muscles had not developed 
  yet. </div>

  <h2>Gaining Experience</h2>
  <div><p>Salah made his debut on the <em>3rd of May</em>, in a 1-1 away
  draw against El Mansoura. During the 2010-11 season, Salah
  became a regular player, yet he had still not scored a goal.
  In the dressing room after matches, he would often be in tears
  because of this, but this motivated Salah to become better. His 
  first goal was on the <em>25th of December 2010</em>, in a 1-1 away
  draw against Al Ahly. He continued to regularly play for Al
  Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011-12 season.</p>

  and on the <em>10th of March 2012</em>, the <strong>Egyptian Football Association</strong>
  announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.
